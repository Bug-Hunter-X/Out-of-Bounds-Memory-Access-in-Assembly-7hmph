This repository contains an example of an out-of-bounds memory access bug in assembly code and its solution. The bug is caused by accessing an array element using an index that is outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to unexpected behavior or program crashes. The solution involves adding bounds checking to ensure that the index is always within the valid range. This example uses x86 assembly language.  Understanding and addressing memory access violations is crucial for writing robust and secure assembly programs.
